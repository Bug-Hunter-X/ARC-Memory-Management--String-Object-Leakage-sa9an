In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

If `someMethod` is called multiple times, each call creates a new `NSString` object and assigns it to `myString`.  However, the previous `NSString` instance is not explicitly released (although ARC handles this under the hood).  While ARC prevents immediate crashes, this can result in significant memory bloat over time if `someMethod` is called frequently or within a loop without explicitly releasing the previous `myString` when needed. This is especially problematic with large or frequently-changing objects. The solution requires a check that handles the existence and prior allocation of a string object.
